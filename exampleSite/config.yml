# Welcome to the cState configuration file!
#
# If you are using an earlier version, or one
# in the future, such as v8.0 you may see errors
# pop up when deploying a cState website.
#
# Now, onto the fun part.
#
# Hugo is used for building the status page,
# so this file can be used to change how
# your status page should behave or look.
#
# If you want to use special characters,
# such as accented letters, you MUST save
# the file as UTF-8, not ANSI.
#
# If cState does not load, ensure that:
#  - No tabs are present;
#    YAML only allows spaces
#  - Indents are correct
#    YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
#  - You have "escaped" all apostrophes
#    in your text: If you want to write "don't",
#    for example, write "don''t" instead!
#    Note the doubled apostrophe.
#  - Text with symbols is enclosed in single
#    or double quotation marks.
#
# If you have problems, create an issue on GitHub:
# https://github.com/cstate/cstate/issues

# What is your status page called?
# Shows up in the browser bar and meta tags
title: Eggsample Status

# Should posts, which have a publish date
# from the future, be built? Useful for
# sharing upcoming maintenance, etc.
#
# We recommend to keep this at `true`.
# BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
buildFuture: true

# What language do you want to use for the
# html[lang] definition?
#
# Does not change language of site
# itself.
#
# Default: `en`
# ISO 639-1 defines abbreviations.
#
# See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
# Also: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp
languageCode: en

# What translation file should cState use?
# You can also define whether missing
# translations should get placeholders.
#
# For defaultContentLanguage—
# Default: `en`
#
# For enableMissingTranslationPlaceholders—
# do not set it to true for languages other
# than English! When tested with Lithuanian,
# it would add unnecesary placeholders to
# values that were intentionally empty.
defaultContentLanguage: en

# What is the hostname or path to the root?
# Where is the site hosted?
#
# ❗ cState & Hugo don’t support '/' in
# production use. It will break RSS
# feeds and breaks permalinks since
# version 3. If you are just testing,
# localhost should automatically work.
#
# Example: 
# baseUrl: https://status.example.com/
#
# For testing:
# baseUrl: http://localhost
#
# Broken example:
# baseUrl: /
baseURL: https://example.com

# For features like Last modified, you
# need to use a Git repository. If you
# are using Netlify, you are already
# using Git (with GitHub, GitLab, etc)
#
# So, should Git information be used
# for this website?
#
# We recommend to keep this at `true`.
# BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
enableGitInfo: true

  # Before setting up your systems, you need
  # to first define at least one category.
  #
  # Categories are shown in the order that
  # you define in this config file.
  #
  # Categories can have a:
  # - name
  # - description
  # - closed boolean `closed: true`
  #   That would collapse the category upon first load
  #   and the user can expand by clicking on the category
  #   (Requires JavaScript.)
  # - untitled boolean `untitled: true`
  #   This would complerely hide the name of the category.
  #   This is useful, if you do not want to use categories
  #   because you need to set an 'Uncategorized' category.
  #   Or it can be used alongside other categories.
  #
  # These are case sensitive.
  # 
  # For help, see the wiki:

  # What date format to use?
  #
  # Hugo formatting docs:
  # https://gohugo.io/functions/format/#hugo-date-and-time-templating-reference
  #
  # Technical: GOLANG/HUGO .Date.Format & dateFormat
  #
  # dateFormat Default: "January 2, 2006 at 3:04 PM"
  # shortDateFormat Default: "15:04 — Jan 2"
  dateFormat: January 2, 2006 at 3:04 PM UTC
  shortDateFormat: 15:04 UTC — Jan 2

  # Should relative time (x min ago) be used?
  #
  # IMPORTANT: In the frontmatter, the dates MUST be in
  # the UTC time zone for this to work preperly. If you 
  # use Netlify CMS, all good — the CMS picks UTC time
  # by default. Otherwise, there may be very inaccurate
  # times if multiple time zones are in your issue files.
  #
  # FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION: This feature was introduced in
  # v5. It may be a breaking change in the case when you
  # wish to use relative time but old issues do not have
  # UTC time (and therefore are out of sync by ±24 hours)
  #
  # Read the wiki for more: 
  # https://github.com/cstate/cstate/wiki/Customization#time 
  #
  # If enabled, will display relative times in places like
  # the incident history and summaries instead of using
  # dateFormat and shortDateFormat (except for if you use
  # the old shortcode).
  #
  # Default: `true`
  # BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
  useRelativeTime: true
 
  # If enabled, doesn't show seconds on relative times.
  #
  # With option ON (true):
  # "Last checked <1 min ago"
  #
  # With option OFF (false; default):
  # "Last checked 20s ago"
  #
  # Default: `false`
  # BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
  skipSeconds: false

  # Should there be an automatic "Last updated"
  # text shown below issues?
  #
  # Default: `true`
  # BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
  enableLastMod: true

  # What header design should we use?
  #
  # Default: `true`
  # BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
  useLargeHeaderDesign: false

  # Should incident history be separated
  # like in an archive view?
  #
  # Note: This WILL disable pagination.
  #
  # Default: `yearly`
  # STRING; `monthly`, `yearly`, `none`
  incidentHistoryFormat: "yearly"

  # Should incident history be hidden?
  #
  # By disabling the incident history, you also disable
  # the RSS feed. To ensure no incidents are shown, you
  # should delete them after they are resolved. This option
  # overrides any other options that tailor your incident
  # history’s look.
  #
  # Default: `false`
  # BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
  disableIncidentHistory: false

  # Disable dark mode
  #
  # If your OS and browser support the
  # `prefers-color-scheme` media query,
  # cState will automatically switch to
  # a darker user interface.
  #
  # cState uses its built-in colors for
  # most of the interface to ensure
  # a good user experience.
  #
  # Default: `false`
  # BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
  disableDarkMode: false

  # Should we show the logo or the title
  # of the status page?
  #
  # Default: `false`
  # BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
  useLogo: true

  # Where is the logo located, if one is
  # present at all?
  #
  # Recommended: png is best used for
  # images like logos.
  #
  # Recommended: png, bmp, jpg, or gif
  # for best browser support!

  # If the status page shows that
  # there are disruptions or outages
  # happening, should it keep the
  # brand header color or drop it
  # and use the status indication
  # colors that were just defined?
  #
  # Default: `true`
  # BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
  alwaysKeepBrandColor: true

  # Introduced in v4.0.1 for consistent
  # site title text color.
  #
  # If you do not use the logo, what color
  # should the site text color be?
  #
  # Removing this option will not force
  # any site text color. This is likely
  # unwanted behavior.
  #
  # Default: `white`
  # STRING; `white`, `black`, or nothing
  headerTextColor: white

  # Google Analytics tracking code
  #
  # By default, cState does not use
  # Google Analytics. If you choose
  # to use it, you may change the
  # placeholder code below to your
  # own and thereby enable the
  # tracking service.
  #
  # To disable the analytics, change
  # the value to the default:
  #
  # Default: UA-00000000-1
  googleAnalytics: UA-00000000-1

# These options affect the core of cState.
# Please do not change them if you do not
# know what you are doing.
